# Responsive-CHALLENGE
Weeks 03, 04 & 05.

## Project Description:
The student have to develop a news portal, it has to be responsive in order to adapt to different devices. Also, the news portal
has a register form for new users. The fields from the form has the proper validations.

**Validations logic**
First of all i declare the variables which contains the selectors of the elements from the DOM, as well as the regex.

Then i created functions in order to reuse code related to the styles.

After that i created, for each field, a function that's going to be useful to validate the input as well as the final validation
with the emergent board which will contain the user data or the invalid inputs.

Then i added events to the elements (blur, focus).
